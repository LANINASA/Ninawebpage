                I used to take three additional subject which are computer science, perniagaan and tasawwur islam. My high school experience is very a big journey for me because
                I learned a lot from high school that includes friendships, hardships in achieving good results, how to be discpline on how to be a responsible person and more. 
                Despite of all of my hardships in high school, it was still the best part of my life because life get harder when you grow up. In a nutshell,
                I feel so happy since i got to spend a wonderful expereince in this high school.

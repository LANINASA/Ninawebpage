            <p class="indented"> I do not have much experience since I am still a student, but I do have experience of working part-time during my semester break. 
            Every semester break, I like to fill in my time by working a part-timer to collect a little bit of experience that involves working out there.
            Moreover, I prefer to work part-time so that I can prepare myself to work in the future. Working part-time helped me to learn more about life out there,
            such as how to interact with people, how to solve my problems and more. I used to be a part-timer at Mykori, which is a cafe, and it was a very good opportunity for me to work there.
            However, my experience as a student taught me that we must prioritise our priorities, value time, learn how to deal with problems, and remember that our mental health is just as 
            important as our physical health.</p>

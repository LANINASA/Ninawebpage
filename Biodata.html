            <p class="indented"> My name is <b>Nina sabrina binti nor sabri </b> but most of my friends and family members call me nina. 
                I am a diploma student and currently pursuing my final year for the information management course at UiTM, Rembau. 
                I was born in <b> 19 May, 2001</b> at britannia hospital kajang and has been living in Taman Bukit Meringin, Kajang for 18 years. 
                Hence, I have 4 siblings including me, 2 girls and 2 boys. As many people might guess, I am the eldest in the family.My friends say that I am a very funny, friendly and outgoing person. 
                As soon as I meet new people who are happy to meet me, I feel very comfortable to be friends with them. 
                believe that friendship is one of the most important values in human life since we can exchange new ideas, 
                find many interesting things about each other and also experience new things in life.Moreover, being a sociable person,
                I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals.
                I enjoy my time at college, it is really nice to study, the students are very friendly and ready to help.
                The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time.</p> 


                    
            <p> <br> I have a lots of hobbies and I always change my hobbies because
                I tent to easily get bored of doing the same routine in my daily routine. For instance, I like to 
                read,knitting,walking,listen to podcast and journaling.
                I am in love with reading, so the thing I love doing so much became even more enjoyable. 
                I decided to read atleast 2 books in a month. Reading makes me feel so calm and it widens my imagination.
                My current hobby is listening to the podcast and reading.Listening to podcast also has been my favourite go to hobby
                because it calms me down and listening to it makes me feel less lonely. Hence, I like to listen to various types of podcast 
                such as facts, random talks and also crime.</p>

             <p><br>The goal I am currently striving for is to make myself fall in love with this life.
                I would love to wake up one day and be excited to live, to do my daily routines, to help people, 
                to give the best energy to people around me and basically, it would be fun to actually achieve 
                the dream that will make me enjoy life in a long term. There are many bad experiences in my life and
                I am still trying to make me feel excited to live this life but I am very sure that I am currently grateful, 
                full of love, with a desire to study well because it will help me become a successful person in future and to have a high quality of life. 
                In a nutshell, I believe that it is manifesting day by day and I feel motivated to do what I need to and where I have to go.</p> <br>
